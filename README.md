### IBM HR Dataset Analysis
## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling project based on the IBM HR dataset. The project aims to uncover key insights related to employee attrition and identify factors that might influence an employee's decision to leave the company.

## Dataset
The analysis is conducted on the WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv dataset, which includes various attributes related to employee performance, demographics, satisfaction levels, and more. The dataset is structured with rows representing individual employee records and columns representing attributes such as Age, Department, DistanceFromHome, Education, JobRole, MonthlyIncome, OverTime, TotalWorkingYears, Attrition, and several others.

## Installation
To run this analysis, you will need the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Pandas library
NumPy library
Matplotlib library
Seaborn library
Scikit-learn library

## Analysis Overview
The Jupyter notebook IMB HR Dataset Analysis.ipynb contains a detailed analysis, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The notebook is structured as follows:
